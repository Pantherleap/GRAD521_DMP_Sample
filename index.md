# Data description
-My research is the development of a multiplex PCR (polymerase chain reaction) protocol for the rapid identification of E. coli, Salmonella genus, and Listeria monocytogenes in fresh produce, and the subsequent limits of detection. My questions come in the form of finding the correct primers and processing conditions for the mPCR, and identifying the correct limits of detection for the protocol, when used in conjunction with chosen vegetables.
-My data for the development process will come in the form of identifying the correct thermocycler conditions (various temperatures and times), which is highly specific for each primer set. Also, keeping records of the primer compositions and makeups, along with the imaging results for each trial. I do not yet know exactly what data will need to be collected for the second leg of my project, as it is still being speculated upon by my professor.
-The thermocycler data is collected directly from our VWR PCR Thermocycler. The records from the primer compositions are based up my trial and error process with different primer sets, but are based upon a formula.. The imaging results come from a Gel Imaging Machine, and are reported to an attached computer.

# Roles and responsibilities
-For my data collection, the majority of the roles will be occupied by me, Grad Student 1. My project is largely independent, and I am the solitary researcher that has been assigned. From the list provided, I will assume the role of: data manager, data collection/generation, data organization, metadata generation, quality control, data analysis, and access control. My PI has assumed the roles of: archiving and preservation, DMP implementation, and instrumentation maintenance.

# Data standards and metadata
-The data for the thermocycler conditions is recorded manually in my lab notebook, in the form of different temperatures and times for the 5 stage process of mPCR. It is subject to change between each trial. The records for the primer compositions are also recorded in the form of tables in my lab notebook, but also somewhat in excel as well (depending on which trial it is). The images are in the form of jpeg files.
-Currently the development process conditions and primer compositions occupy around 45 pages in a lab notebook, and will get up to be around ~200. The jpeg files, I would guess to come out to a few GB of information.

# Storage and security
-“Sensitive data is defined as information that is protected against unwarranted disclosure. Access to sensitive data should be safeguarded. Protection of sensitive data may be required for legal or ethical reasons, for issues pertaining to personal privacy, or for proprietary considerations.”
The definition of sensitive data above does a good job of outlining the importance of keeping potentially sensitive data in a protected format. The leaking of such data could have serious legal and ethical ramifications, and a considerable legal fallout should it become known that data has not been handled correctly. My research data is not sensitive, does not directly reference or use human subjects, and thus does not require an extreme level of protection.


# Access and data sharing
-My research is funded by the ARF (Agricultural Research Fund), which is a private research promotion group that operates in the produce sector. In the initial proposal, we were asked to outline the methods by which we will store the data. The only legal documents which affect how we manage our data aside from we initial proposal are more along the lines of how we generate the data, because it involves dangerous pathogens, so OSU has a slew of requirements for operating in such conditions. Also, the ARF has added a requirement that we send in quarterly term reports, updating them on the progress being made in the research. These reports are in a scientific journal format, and must contain all relevant information, with appropriate visualization.
