-The data for the thermocycler conditions is recorded manually in my lab notebook, in the form of different temperatures and times for the 5 stage process of mPCR. It is subject to change between each trial. The records for the primer compositions are also recorded in the form of tables in my lab notebook, but also somewhat in excel as well (depending on which trial it is). The images are in the form of jpeg files. -Currently the development process conditions and primer compositions occupy around 45 pages in a lab notebook, and will get up to be around ~200. The jpeg files, I would guess to come out to a few GB of information.
