-The data for the thermocycler conditions is recorded manually in my lab notebook, in the form of different temperatures and times for the 5 stage process of mPCR. It is subject to change between each trial. The records for the primer compositions are also recorded in the form of tables in my lab notebook, but also somewhat in excel as well (depending on which trial it is). The images are in the form of jpeg files. -Currently the development process conditions and primer compositions occupy around 45 pages in a lab notebook, and will get up to be around ~200. The jpeg files, I would guess to come out to a few GB of information.

-“Sensitive data is defined as information that is protected against unwarranted disclosure. Access to sensitive data should be safeguarded. Protection of sensitive data may be required for legal or ethical reasons, for issues pertaining to personal privacy, or for proprietary considerations.” The definition of sensitive data above does a good job of outlining the importance of keeping potentially sensitive data in a protected format. The leaking of such data could have serious legal and ethical ramifications, and a considerable legal fallout should it become known that data has not been handled correctly. My research data is not sensitive, does not directly reference or use human subjects, and thus does not require an extreme level of protection.
