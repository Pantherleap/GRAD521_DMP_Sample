Data Management: Creation & Optimization of a Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction Process for the Rapid Identification of E. coli, Salmonella genus, and Listeria monocytogenes in Fresh Produce Products

Context: 1.)	My research is the development of a multiplex PCR (polymerase chain reaction) protocol for the rapid identification of E. coli, Salmonella genus, and Listeria monocytogenes in fresh produce, and the subsequent limits of detection. My questions come in the form of finding the correct primers and processing conditions for the mPCR, and identifying the correct limits of detection for the protocol, when used in conjunction with chosen vegetables.
