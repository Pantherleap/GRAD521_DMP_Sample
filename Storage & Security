-“Sensitive data is defined as information that is protected against unwarranted disclosure. Access to sensitive data should be safeguarded. Protection of sensitive data may be required for legal or ethical reasons, for issues pertaining to personal privacy, or for proprietary considerations.” The definition of sensitive data above does a good job of outlining the importance of keeping potentially sensitive data in a protected format. The leaking of such data could have serious legal and ethical ramifications, and a considerable legal fallout should it become known that data has not been handled correctly. My research data is not sensitive, does not directly reference or use human subjects, and thus does not require an extreme level of protection.

My data will be handed to the institution that I am working for (OSU), and stored under my PI's name for an indeterminate amount of time. It will also be handed to the ARF, which is the federal reearch grant which has funded my research. I am not sure how long they will store it, as they also do not specify. 

My backup stradegy is quite simple. All of my data which is not written goes onto a USB flash drive, which is uploaded to my computer's hard drive on a daily basis, which is then backed up to both Google Drive, and a secondary external harddrive that I keep at home. So all of the elctronic files are in a minimum of 4 locations. Upon completion of my project, all of these files will be transferred to Box, and then given to both my PI and the ARF for indefinite storage of their personal descretion.
