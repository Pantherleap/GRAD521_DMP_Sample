-My research is the development of a multiplex PCR (polymerase chain reaction) protocol for the rapid identification of E. coli, Salmonella genus, and Listeria monocytogenes in fresh produce, and the subsequent limits of detection. My questions come in the form of finding the correct primers and processing conditions for the mPCR, and identifying the correct limits of detection for the protocol, when used in conjunction with chosen vegetables. My data for the development process will come in the form of identifying the correct thermocycler conditions (various temperatures and times), which is highly specific for each primer set. Also, keeping records of the primer compositions and makeups, along with the imaging results for each trial. I do not yet know exactly what data will need to be collected for the second leg of my project, as it is still being speculated upon by my professor. The thermocycler data is collected directly from our VWR PCR Thermocycler. The records from the primer compositions are based up my trial and error process with different primer sets, but are based upon a formula.. The imaging results come from a Gel Imaging Machine, and are reported to an attached computer.
